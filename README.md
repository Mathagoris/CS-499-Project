CS 499 Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis Project 2
Project Topic: Hands-on Experience in Cloud Computing and/or Bigdata Analysis.

First, create a cluster and install Hadoop on three computers in the school's computer research lab. Then run at least two MapReduce programs on the cluster. 

The first MapReduce program will be a simple Wordcount program that counts the number of occurences of each word and sorts them in alphabetical order. The second MapReduce program will use Yelp's Academic Dataset that contains reviews of various restaurants, services, etc. located near various colleges around the world. Out of the colleges provided in the dataset, the program will attempt to find which colleges have the highest rated restaurants/food related services located nearby.
